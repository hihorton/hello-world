# hello-world
This repository is for practicing the GitHub Flow.

I'm a father of two boys who enjoys fishing and hands-on projects. A natural tinkerer, I've recently started working with a homelab and developing my technical skills. I'm currently focused on transitioning into the IT fieldâ€”a career path that aligns with my interests.

My goal is to build a better future for my family. This is the beginning of an exciting new journey in my life.
